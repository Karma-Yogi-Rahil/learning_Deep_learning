# Machine Learning 

Machine Learning is the practice of using algorithms to analyse the data , learn from the data and then make a determination or prediction about the new data

Example : Analysing the sentiments of a popular media outlet and with a negative or positive üëáüèª

### Traditional Programing

-   The algorithm may first look a a particular word associated with either negative or positive sentiment
-   with condition statements the algorithm would classify articles as positive or negative based on the words that it knows as positive or negative

### Machine Learning

-   The algorithm would analyse large amount of given media data and learn the feature that classify what a negative article looks like versus a positive article.
-   with what it's learned , the algorithm could then classify new articles as positive or negative
