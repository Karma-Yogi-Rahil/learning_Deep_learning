# Artificial neural network

**Artificial neural networks are deep learning models that are based on the structure of brain neural networks**

-   these networks are based on a collection of connection units called **artificial neurons** or **neurons**
    
-   each connection between neurons can transmit a signal from one top another
    
-   The receiving neuron process the signal and signals downstream neocons connected to it
    
-   neurons are organised in layers
    
    -   input layer
        
    -   hidden layer
        
        anything except input and output layer is called hidden layer
        
    -   output layer
        
-   Artificial neural network are used interchangeably with terms
    
    -   neural net
    -   net
    -   model
